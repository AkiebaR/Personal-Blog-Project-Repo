Personal Blog Project
This is a personal blog project that showcases my web development skills, including HTML and CSS. The project consists of a dynamic and responsive blog design where users can view posts, navigate through pages, and interact with various blog features.

Features:
Responsive design for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
Blog posts with images, titles, and descriptions
Pagination for easy navigation between blog posts
Interactive UI elements for improved user experience using only HTML and CSS

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For the basic structure of the blog
CSS3: For styling and layout (including Flexbox and Grid)
Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration
